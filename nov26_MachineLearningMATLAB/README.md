# Machine Learning with MATLAB

A mini-workshop on November 26th, 2016 about how to implement machine learning algorithms with MATLAB. The workshop was a part of LE701 Computational Tools for Electrical and Computer Engineering, a required course for Master Degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering.

The presentation material can be accessed onine by [this Prezi link](https://prezi.com/pshbxeuy-tck/machine-learning-with-matlab/).

## Requirements
* MATLAB 2016a
* Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox

## Examples
1. **sumAndCountArrivalDelay.m** and **parforSumAndCountArrivalDelay.m** functions to access datastore.
2. **MeanDistMapFun.m** and **MeanDistReduceFun.m** callback functions to learn map-reduce.
